# HTML Forms endpoint

A static website needs an external service for sending forms to e-mail. Sites
which are published to Quiqr Cloud can use the `Quiqr Forms` service for
sending e-mails. The configuration of the form-endpoint is done with a
yaml-file. And the HTML forms only need a simple action endpoint as
configuration.

**Requirements**:

* A working Quiqr website published to the Quiqr Cloud.

**Features**:

* Minimal configuration
* Privacy friendly, no cookies needed
* Multiple email address receivers
*  human check slider
* Server side validations

Read the [Quiqr Forms Quickstart]({{< ref "./forms-quickstart" >}}) to get your form up
and running within 10 minutes.

The section [Quiqr Forms configuration properties]({{< ref
"./quiqr-forms-properties" >}}) is a full reference for all options.
