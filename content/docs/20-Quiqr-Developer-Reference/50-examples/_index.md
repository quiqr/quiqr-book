# Example Configurations

This book shows one example in which a data model of a blog is defined. It's
recommended though to checkout the real life examples in the [Template
Gallery](https://quiqr.github.io/quiqr-community-templates/). This gallery also
contains the [Kitchen Sink
template](https://github.com/quiqr/quiqr-template-kitchen-sink) which shows all
possible form fields in different site properties. The `quiqr/model` folder is
the place to start learning from an example template.
