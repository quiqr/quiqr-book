# Build Actions

Build actions are custom actions which are triggered by a user clicking the action
button. Build actions can be attached to a [Single](/docs/20-quiqr-developer-reference/03-content-model/02-model-file-structure/01-root-properties/05-singles/)
or a [Collection](/docs/20-quiqr-developer-reference/03-content-model/02-model-file-structure/01-root-properties/06-collections/) object.

A build action allows the user to use data stored in a Quiqr site object as
input for an external program. The value that the external program returns can
be displayed, or, if it is a filename, the user can open it.

A typical use case for a build action would a PDF builds. Using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
or [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) a markdown file could be converted to a nicely
formatted PDF file.

## Variables

Before a build action is executed variables will be replaced by a their real
values. There are standard Quiqr site variables like `SITE_PATH` and there
are custom declared variables. The custom declared variables can be overruled
in the [global variable
preferences](/docs/20-quiqr-developer-reference/30-global-preferences/20-variables/)
of the installed Quiqr application.

A `%` symbol needs to be written before a variable name in the definition to
let Quiqr know it should be replaced with the real value.

Available standard quiqr site variables:

- SITE_PATH: Is replaced with the root folder of the site. E.g. `/Users/pim/Quiqr/sites/my-documents`.
- DOCUMENT_PATH: Is replaced with the path of the file which opened by the user. E.g. `/Users/pim/Quiqr/sites/my-documents/content/quotations/001-johnson.md`.

## Properties

These are the properties of one build action.

| execute.unix.command    | string                  | mandatory  | File path to the executable to run. Be aware to enter full paths as Quiqr has no PATH variable set. Variables are replaced before execution.             |
| execute.unix.args       | array of strings        | optional   | All arguments used by the executable. Variables are replaced before execution.                                                                           |

| execute.windows.command | string                  | mandatory  | File path to the executable to run. Be aware to enter full paths as Quiqr has no PATH variable set. Variables are replaced before execution.             |
| execute.windows.args    | array of strings        | optional   | All arguments used by the executable. Variables are replaced before execution.                                                                           |

### stdout_type's

- *value = file_path* - When set to `file_path` a link to open the result file is displayed after the build action was finished succesfully.
- *value = message* - When set to `message` the return value is displayed after the build action was finished succesfully.
- *value = ascii_message* - When set to `ascii_message` the return value is displayed after the build action was finished succesfully. A fixed font is used to maintain correct layout.
