# Get started

Quiqr lets you publish to the web easily. The best way to get started with Quiqr is
download the Quiqr Application, create a new site from a template, and publish
this to the web.

Read on or [Watch the Quickstart video](/docs/10-getting-started/10.quick-start-video/).

## Install

[Download and install](/docs/10-getting-started/01.installation/) the latest version for your system.

## Start Quiqr for the first time.

When you start Quiqr for the first time, you have no websites yet. You can
create new or import from several sources, but to understand the concept of
Quiqr right away, just [import a Quiqr
Template](/docs/10-getting-started/02.import-site/) and play a
little with the CMS.

## Preview website

From the moment you have created a website and opened it, a hugo server is
running on your computer. Hit the Preview in Browser button to show how your
website looks like.

## Publish to the web

To publish to the web you have to setup a sync target. Currently you can sync
to a GitHub-repository and to a folder. The folder needs to be copied to a public server manually.
