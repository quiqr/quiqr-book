# Bundle manager

The `bundle-manager` is a container field for creating a file-manager form for
managing the assets of page bundles. The word page bundle refers to [Hugo's
Page Bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/). A page
bundle is a way of organizing a page inside it's own directory together with
it's resources.

It's not possible to use Bundle managers with pages which are not stored as
page bundle.

## Bundle image thumbnail

The `bundle-image-thumbnail` field is a special field to be used together with
bundle-manager containers. It's creates preview image thumbnails of selected
images.

```Read [bundle-image-thumbnail documentation]({{< ref path="../layout-field-types/bundle-image-thumbnail.md" >}}) for more information.```
